Our first broadcast was a success, and we'd like to invite everyone
back with friends for the next:

Our second broadcast is on Tuesday, May 5, 2020, at 20:30 Central
European Time ([convert to your time](/time/)).  The stream starts 10
minutes early and you can use this time to already start asking
questions questions you may have.
