Our third broadcast is on Tuesday, May 12, 2020, at 20:30 Oslo time/ 21:30 Helsinki time
([convert to your time](/time/)).

We will talk about tracking dependencies for compiled languages,
about versioning for smaller and larger projects, and about how we
document our codes, and more.

The stream starts 10
minutes early and you can use this time to already start asking
questions you may have.

### Questions and anwsers from our collaborative document

- Specifying dependencies for a project tends to be quite language dependant. There is a strong convention for a requirements.txt in Python for instance. Is there a language independent way to make your dependencies clear and easily usable?
  - Not really. Quite often projects describe their OS/OS library/other library needs in that order.

- Are there specific journals where one can publish science codes/libraries that are applied in scientific projects, together with documentation and a short explanatory paper? Such a 'publication' hardly qualifies for the standard scientific journals, but might still be relevant for publication.
  - These are generally called software metapapers. Some examples:
    - [JOSS](joss.theoj.org/)
    - [JORS](openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/)
    - [SoftwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/softwarex)
  - NeuroImage publishes ["Toolbox and Software"](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/neuroimage/1053-8119/guide-for-authors#txt20105) papers.

- Does meson or scons makes things easier, compared to autotools or a makefile or cmake?
  - Not sure but CMake, autotools, and makefiles clearly dominate research software (as far as I can see)

- Can you FetchContent from Zenodo?
  - it is possible to fetch from a URL/Tarball, I think it should be possible. I will try it out.

- Do you gitignore every dependency under your "external/" subfolder or do you add everything to your repo? (I have found my code in the 'external' subfolder of other repositories)
  - A [solution](http://www.nils-haldenwang.de/frameworks-and-tools/git/how-to-ignore-changes-in-git-submodules) is to set `ignore=dirty` if you use submodules

- [Calendar versioning](https://calver.org/) ? Yes, +1 for calendar versioning.
    - It works for distributions, or websites etc, maybe not for libraries?

- If you're interested on scientific software installation with scientific software build systems, check [spack](https://spack.io/) and [easybuild](https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). -Simo

- On GitHub, if you have lines selected, you can hit "y" to automatically put the permalink with the hash in the URL.
  - awesome!
