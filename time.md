We broadcast on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rshour) every Tuesday at 20:30 Central European Time /
21:30 East European Time.  You can [check this

in your timezone.

On Linux, you can find the next time by running the following command
from your terminal:

```
$ date --date='TZ="Europe/Helsinki" 21:30 next Tue'
```
