Created with GIMP.  Edit the .xcf file, save, then export to the
PNGs.  Mind the layers.

Text comes from a Debian xterm default font (either 'default' or
'huge' size), scaled up.  They are scaled up at integer multiples of
pixels, to rescale, figure out the scaling, scale down by that much,
then up to what you want.  Scale with "None" for interpolation.
