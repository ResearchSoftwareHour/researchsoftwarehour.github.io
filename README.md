# Research Software Hour website

If you want to contribute to RSH, see the
[rsh-notes](https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes/)
repository for now.


### How the GitHub Pages part works

The website is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).
Note that the `gh-pages` branch is generated on each push/merge to `main`
branch. The branch `gh-pages` should not be manually modified.


### Local preview

- Install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)
- Serve locally: `$ zola serve`

CSS is using [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/).
