Each week, we want to do some simple stuff, some more advanced stuff, some
stuff more towards software/programming, some stuff more towards
scientific computing/Linux.  Most important, we want to show you the
*spirit and joy of computing*.

See the full list of our latest ideas in [the rsh-notes
repository](https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes) and
suggest more there.  *Broad categories and examples* below, and our
program will evolve as our audience likes:


* **Research software**, since these days so many people need to
  produce it, regardless of background: structuring software,
  profiling, demonstrating useful packages for research, releasing
  software, pair programming in our normal work.

* **Scientific computing support skills**, tools you need to do
  scientific computing: git, automated testing, documentation, working
  with pip/conda, Github, Jupyter.

* **Evaluate watcher-submitted code**: We'll take code our watchers
  submit, evaluate on stream and improve it.  Suggest by making an
  issue in the [rse-notes
  repository](https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes)

* Go through bits of **regular courses**, such as
  [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/).

* **Unix and Linux tools**, since this is the base which most
  scientific computing is built on: bash, ssh, tmux/screen, shell
  scripting, etc.

* **Data management**, since often the data is harder than the code:
  optimizing data access, data formats, repositories, sharing data.

* **Open science and reproducibility**, since good software leads to
  good science and vice versa: preparing software for release and wide
  use, releasing software, making software citeable.

* **Discussion time**, we answer any questions you may have.  Try to
  stump us!
