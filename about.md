RSH is an interactive, streaming web show all about scientific
computing and research software.

Programming can be fun.  Research can be fun.  But when combined, many
skills fall through the gaps.  We think that computing is best learned
like an apprenticeship, but unfortunately most researchers don't have
access to high-quality computing mentorship.

We'll develop the program based on suggestions and also to maximize fun
for us, but broadly speaking we wish to:

* Have entertaining discussions about research software and
  computing.  Show why we enjoy it so much and how you can, too.

* Teach tips and tricks (and learn new ones ourselves, too) - at least
  introduce new ideas and point you where to look for more info.

* Take code submitted by users and go through it and discuss how we'd
  improve it - to show our whole thought process. We will do this constructively
  and also critically review our own codes which we have written some time
  ago.

* Show you the errors we make and how we get through them.  And do our
  own learning at the same time, too. We are not experts in everything and we
  believe in the pedagogy of errors and typos.

* We'll cover everything from research software and data to high-performance
  computing and Linux.

This is an open source production - anyone can help us develop RSH,
too.  [Join us!](https://github.com/researchsoftwarehour/)

## About us

[Radovan Bast](https://bast.fr) is a research software engineer
with background in theoretical chemistry.
He's worked in France, Stockholm, and now
Tromsø at the border between science, software, and computational
support and enjoys supporting multi-disciplinary research.
He now works as part of the [Sigma2 metacenter](https://documentation.sigma2.no/)
at the University of Tromsø, Norway, and
leads the [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org) project.

Richard
Darst is a computational data scientist with background in network science and theoretical chemistry,
and has worked in the United States and Finland.  He now
works for [Aalto Scientific Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi) at
Aalto University, Finland.  They met through the [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org) project,
which teaches best practices in research software, and also
collaborate on the [Nordic Research Software Engineer community
project](https://nordic-rse.org) and
[NordicHPC](https://nordichpc.github.io).

Together, we have decades of experience programming for science,
mentoring, and teaching computing. We have seen a *crisis of
computing*, where computing demands are increasing while there isn't a
corresponding increase in the *practical skills* that go along with
it.  Mentoring does not reach enough people, and teaching does not
take the role of hands-on mentoring or convey spirit of computing (and
also still doesn't reach enough people).
There is also lack of time and academic credit for investing time in improving
programming and computing skills.

Thus, we need another strategy.  We are trying this web show to
combine informal teaching with the *feeling and spirit* of computing.


## Topics

Each week, we want to do some simple stuff, some more advanced stuff, some
stuff more towards software/programming, some stuff more towards
scientific computing/Linux.  Most important, we want to show you the
*spirit and joy of computing*.

See the full list of our latest ideas in [the rsh-notes
repository](https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes) and
suggest more there.  *Broad categories and examples* below, and our
program will evolve as our audience likes:


* **Research software**, since these days so many people need to
  produce it, regardless of background: structuring software,
  profiling, demonstrating useful packages for research, releasing
  software, pair programming in our normal work.

* **Scientific computing support skills**, tools you need to do
  scientific computing: git, automated testing, documentation, working
  with pip/conda, Github, Jupyter.

* **Evaluate watcher-submitted code**: We'll take code our watchers
  submit, evaluate on stream and give suggestions for improvements. Suggest by making an
  issue in the [rse-notes
  repository](https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes)

* Go through bits of **regular courses**, such as
  [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/).

* **Unix and Linux tools**, since this is the base which most
  scientific computing is built on: bash, ssh, tmux/screen, shell
  scripting, etc.

* **Data management**, since often the data is harder than the code:
  optimizing data access, data formats, repositories, sharing data.

* **Open science, reproducibility, and credit**, since good software leads to
  good science and vice versa: preparing software for release and wide
  use, releasing software, making software citeable.

* **Discussion time**, we answer any questions you may have.  Try to
  stump us! We will all learn from each other.
