Research Software Hour is a online stream/show about scientific
computing and research software.  It is designed to provide the
skills typically picked up via informal networks: each week, we do
some combination of exploring new tools, analyzing and improving
someone's research code, and discussion.  Watchers can take part and
contribute code to us which we analyze and discuss on stream.

We broadcast on Twitch every Tuesday at 20:30 Central European Time /
21:30 East European time (planned length of 1.5 hours).  You can find
the next time by running `date --date='TZ="Europe/Helsinki" 21:30 next
Tue'` from your terminal, or check [this

Twitter streams [@__radovan](https://twitter.com/__radovan) or
[@SciCompAalto](https://twitter.com/SciCompAalto) for updates.
