Research Software Hour is an online stream/show about scientific
computing and research software.  It is designed to provide the
skills typically picked up via informal networks: each week, we do
some combination of exploring new tools, analyzing and improving
someone's research code, and discussion.

Watchers can take part and contribute code to us which we analyze and discuss
on stream.

We broadcast on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rshour) Tuesdays at
20:30 Oslo time / 21:30 Helsinki time.  [Convert to your
