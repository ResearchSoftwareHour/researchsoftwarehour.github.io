Research Software Hour is a online show discussing scientific
computing and research software designed to provide the informal kind
of skills you don't learn academically.  Each week, we broadcast for
1.5 hours and cover some combination of discussion, exploring new
tools, and analyzing and improving someone's research code.  Watchers
can contribute code to us which we analyze and discuss on stream.

We broadcast on Twitch every Tuesday at 20:30 Central European Time /
21:30 East European time.  You can probably find the next time by
running `date --date='TZ="Europe/Helsinki" 21:30 next Tue'` from your
terminal, or check [this
