There are several ways to reach us:

* The **Twitch stream**
  * You can use the Twitch chat to interact with us, but we prefer the
    HackMD pad (because we can thread discussions and share it afterwards).
* A **HackMD pad**, which we use to share code, links, etc.
  * Always write at the very bottom of the hackpad, unless you are
    replying to someone.
  * You may also write questions at the end of the hackpad.
  * Answer other people in the hackpad.
* Give us **suggestions as issues** in [the rsh-notes
  repository](https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes/issues).
  We would especially like contributed research code (open
  licenseable), which we can analyze on-stream and give (constructive)
  suggestions for improving reproducibility.
* Updates/news on **Twitter** [@\_\_radovan](https://twitter.com/__radovan) or
  [@SciCompAalto](https://twitter.com/SciCompAalto).
