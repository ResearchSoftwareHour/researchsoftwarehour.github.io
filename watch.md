We broadcast on Twitch every Tuesday at 20:30 Central European Time /
21:30 East European time.  You can probably find the next time by
running the following command from your terminal:

```
$ date --date='TZ="Europe/Helsinki" 21:30 next Tue'
```

Watcher's tools:

* The Twitch stream
  * You can use the Twitch chat to interact with us, but we prefer the
    HackMD pad (because we can thread discussions and share it afterwards).
* A HackMD pad, which we use to share code, links, etc.
  * Always write at the very bottom of the hackpad, unless you are
    replying to someone.
  * You may also write questions at the end of the hackpad.
  * Answer other people in the hackpad.
* Give us suggestions as issues in [the rsh-notes
  repository](https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes/issues).
  We would especially like contributed research code (open
  licenseable), which we can analyze on-stream and give (constructive)
  suggestions for improving reproducibility.
* Updates/news on Twitter [@\_\_radovan](https://twitter.com/__radovan) or
  [@SciCompAalto](https://twitter.com/SciCompAalto).
