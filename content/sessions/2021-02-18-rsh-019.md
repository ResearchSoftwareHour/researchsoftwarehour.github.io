### Questions/comments

- Intro to shell (and HPC): https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZLVmS9rf3nN_tMPgqoUQac9bTjZw8JYc

- Will you also show some tricks for macOS users?
  - Anything particular that you would like to know more about or see? (I think we use Linux and Windows ...)
      - No, because I came to learn :-)
         - Hopefully we will show useful things but maybe a watcher who uses macOS can also comment?
      - Mac user here: what works for Linux is basically also going to work on Mac, or at least I still have not found something that wouldn't work on both :) [however x11 is not preinstalled, so you need Xquartz]
        - Yes, so far I have not really discovered anything that only worked on Mac. Ah, okay, I get X11 via Xcode.
            - I personally don't want to install xcode because it's an elephant :)
                - I realised! I will have a look for Xquartz. Thank you!

- does X11 forwarding require any setup/installation on your side?
  - seems like no, nothing special required
  - Make sure x11-Forwarding box is ticked (it is by default) in Advanced SSH settings

- Can you switch on / off $CDPATH? Or do I have to change it each time.
  - Richard will answer later (Radovan: I am not using this yet)

- Many shells exist
  - Bash, Fish, zsh, csh, tcsh, ...
  - xonsh https://xon.sh/
  - elvish https://elv.sh/
    - hmm! new to me

- Could you maybe comment on what are the advantages/disadvantages of the various shells? So far, I have only used bash. macOS offers now to switch to zsh.
  - great question, we will come back to this
      - Thank you.

- When I type in bash echo $CDPATH I get only an empty line. Did Richard setup this $CDPATH?
  - yes I think he set it in .bashrc (?) where one can set variables and aliases
  - You can try it out by defining CDPATH to one of your folder.

- Many shells: is there a fast way to switch between them (e.g. I am on bash and then want to go to fish)? I guess by just typing the shell name?
  - yes. I use fish but sometimes need bash and then I type "bash" and enter and I am in bash. And vice versa. Alternative: if this is a script, you indicate with a shebang on top which shell it should use. Example: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

- Let's also talk of sharing our shell config across systems
  - yes!
  - RD: I have one master .bashrc file one of my computers.  All edits go there, it gets copied to other computers.  So master config is always clear
      - Is this really so important? I never bothered. Maybe I am not advanced or not using the full shell potential.
         - I am switching between 3 computers and really appreciate that when I make an improvement on computer 1, I don't have to reinvent it on computers 2 and 3. I don't use any fancy solution but share my dotfiles via GitHub: https://github.com/bast/config
            - Okay, the master is in a private repo on github?
              - It's public. But I keep the more sensitive settings (ssh config) in another (private) repo.

- Do you use non-bash shells also on HPC clusters? I have seen that other shells than bash can give issues...
  - on clusters I recommend to use bash. I have tried zsh but some tools (module, lmod) assume bash and can break with "non-standard" shells.
  - I see lmod has a fish profile.  But if your admins make it usable is another question.
    - hmm! I need to try this again then. I gave up after zsh didn't work but never tried fish - thanks!


### Anne

- Terminal for Windows users: MobaXterm
  - https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/


### Richard

- `CDPATH`
  - just like `PATH` is used for running programs, `CDPATH` is used for `cd`
  - I set `CDPATH=~/git/`, so that I can `cd project-name` for any project in git directly
  -

- ! aliases
  - We often need to re-run a command with the same argument.  For example, you often `mkdir dir-name` and then `cd dir-name`.  We want to type less?
  - `!$` means last argument of last command line.  `!` commands expand to recent history.  `$` means "last argument"
  - `!!` means entire previous line
  - There is much more I won't go into
  - (don't say) Line designator
    - `!-n` refers to n:th previous line
    - `!string` is recent line beginning with `string`, or `!?string?` for previous line containing string
  - (don't say) Word designator: `:` + symbol, sometimes `:` optional
    - `0`: zeroth argument (program name)
    - `^`: first argument
    - `$`: last argument
    - `x`, `x-y`, `x-`: range of word numbers.
  - (don't say) Modifiers
    - `h`: remove trailing filename
    - `t`: remove head, leave only last pathname
  - Important options
    - `shopt -s histreedit`
    - `shopt -s histverify` - don't run, verify before running
  - bash manual page section: [HISTORY EXPANSION](https://manpages.debian.org/bash/bash.1.en.html#HISTORY_EXPANSION)


- per-directory bash history
  - I have a per-directory shell history, which gets saved in `_bashhist` in each directory (once the shell terminates).
  -
  - You can see the commands in hackmd, you can also find ideas in stack overflow.
  - I have aliases `histsave`, `histread`, `histoff` as well
  - Ignore this in git: ~/.gitignore, `git config core.excludesfile=~/.gitignore`.
  - Warning: I wrote this myself, there are possibly bugs I haven't resolved yet.
```
histsave() { history -a ; }
histread() { history -n ; history -n ; } # Needs it twice somehow...
histoff()  { HISTFILE=/dev/null ; }
cd_hook() {
    # This function handles a per-directory history file
    history -a
    command cd "$@" ;
    if [ -z "$PS1" -o -z "$HISTFILE" -o "$HISTFILE" = "/dev/null" ] ; then
        # Don't do histfile magic if not in interactive mode, HISTFILE
        # is unset or set to /dev/null
        return
    fi
    #if echo "$PWD" | grep "^$HOME" >> /dev/null && test -w . -a -O . -a -G .;
    #if test -w . -a -O . -a -G .;
    if test -w . ;
    then
        # Within home directory
        HISTFILE=./_bashhist
    else
        HISTFILE=~/.bash_history
    fi
}

alias cd=cd_hook
cd_hook $PWD
if [ "$PS1" -a x$_loaded_hist_once = x ] ; then
    history -r
    _loaded_hist_once=True
fi
```

- Git aliases as bash aliases
  - We saw this when I tailed my `_bashhist` file, I used a lot of different aliases
  - This way I can run `ci` instead of `git ci` that is aliased to `git commit -v`:
```
if [ -n "$PS1" ] ; then
    for gitalias in $(git config --name-only --get-regex ^alias.) ; do
        #echo $gitalias
        gitalias="${gitalias#*.}"
        if ! type "$gitalias" &> /dev/null ; then
            eval alias "${gitalias}='git ${gitalias}'"
        fi
    done ; unset gitalias
fi
```


### Roberto

I'll use the terminal in this [binder instance](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/robertodr/nix-demo/HEAD)

- why fish
- direnv
- nix-shell

- The prompt of my fish shell is configured using [starship](starship.rs)

- Where does nix store things per-user?  I see /nix, so this is like a top-level OS add-on?
  - all dependencies are hashed and the paths are the hashes. This means that it can be stored top-level and if two people install the same dependency, it does not have to be twice on the hard-drive. So it's great for clusters (I wish clusters would use this ...)
- Can you have multiple environments?
  - yes (but I don't remember how but Roberto knows and will fill in ...)
    - Yes, you can have as many shells as you need/want. I usually have one `shell.nix` inside every project folder and this gives me a different environment for every project.
- What are the differences between Nix and Guix?
  - I think it's a similar idea implemented in two versions. Both are really nice. (but I have only tried the former)
    - The language is different and there might be some differences in what packages are accepted in the "canonical" repo for licensing reasons. I have never used Guix myself.

- can direnv load virtualenvs/conda environments?
  - yes, any valid bash can be executed by .direnv
  - would you do it by `source venv/bin/activate` in the .direnv?  can you tell it to unload when leaving the directory?
  - OK, I see it is done with these functions that are smart about it



### Radovan

- what I like about fish
  - aliases are functions
  - autosuggestions and colors
  - history is per-directory and context-aware
  - simpler syntax (at the cost of not being POSIX-compilant)
  - on a supercomputer/cluster I still advise to use bash (many tools assume bash and break otherwise)
- jumping between folders (cd -, pushd, popd)
- for loops: renaming many files at once
- let's use some command that I don't use every day
- tldr
  - There's also a Rust implementation of it! It's called [tealdeer](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer)
- reusing past commands (reverse-i-search with CTRL+R)
  - I use [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) with Bash
- editing past commands (how to move to start or end of a line: CTRL+A or CTRL+E)


- That for loop was MATLAB syntax! :D <3
  - oh! TIL!

- Never tried but I heard good things about [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to keep track of dot files
  - thanks for sharing this!
