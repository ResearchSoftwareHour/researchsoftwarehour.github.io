# Git conflicts

## Session outline

- What is a conflict in git
    - example repository: https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/demo-git-conflict
    - is a conflict bad?


- How to understand conflicts
    - graph on GitHub: https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/demo-git-conflict/network
    - graph on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/bast/demo-git-conflict/-/network/main
    - git graph `$ git config --global alias.graph "log --all --graph --decorate --oneline"`
    - view your ("ours") changes separately
    - view their ("theirs") changes separately
    - when to expect a conflict:
      - two branches modified same portion of the code in two different ways
      - one branch modified a file, another branch deleted the file
    - when not to expect a conflict
      - modify different portions of the same file
      - one modification is ancestor of the other modification


- How to minimize conflicts
    - communication
    - keep branches as focused as possible
    - keep branches as short-lived as possible
    - pull before you do new work


- Useful config
    - `$ git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3`
    - I have in my .gitconfig:
    ```cfg
    [merge]
        conflictstyle = diff3
        tool = meld
    [mergetool]
        keepBackup = false
    [mergetool.meld]
        useAutoMerge = true
    ```


- Our general strategies
    - Resolve it the classic way
    - Decide "these do the same thing" and keep the more recent/active branch version
    - Recognize that one branch is "better" and keep one of the two (see later: ours/theirs), maybe transplant few changes manually on top
- Locally
    - example: we clone https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/demo-git-conflict
    - merge conflict resolution on command line
    - git status and git diff in a conflicting merge
    - most scary of the methods
    - visual tools


- Ours/theirs strategy
    - on all conflicting files
      ```bash
      $ git merge -s recursive -Xours somebranch
      $ git merge -s recursive -Xtheirs somebranch
      ```
    - ours/theirs on only few files


- Conflict resolution on the web
    - GitHub
    - GitLab


- How to abort a conflicting merge
    - a merge/rebase only modifies my current branch, never the other branch
    - how to check whether it will conflict


- What is git rebase
    - how a `git rebase` differs from a `git merge`: https://coderefinery.github.io/git-branch-design/01-rebase/
    - rebase is not a free ticket out of a conflict: show how to resolve when rebasing
    - conflicts appear separately, one by one, instead of all in one as in a merge conflict


- Other strategies


## Questions/comments

- Research Software Hour intro tune can be found at: https://soundcloud.com/w-m-vanvliet/research-software-hour-intro-tune
     - Licence CC-BY, feel free to remix and make better
     - Note: Quality is very bad because of how we played it, we need
       solve this for next time.

- Nice that you are back! My question is: Does this git graph command work always? Or does it need special packages on the host cluster, please?
  - It's an alias, it adds some extra options to "git log" so always works.  Well, maybe not on very old git, but all the options are pretty old.

- Rebase means just to attach a branch somewhere else to the head, please? Or at least at another position of the main (?) branch, please?
  - Yes, basically transplanting part to another.  As you might expect you can do lots of different things...

- Does it have to be always main or could it be also another branch?
  - ... like attach it to a different branch, different commit, etc.  There are `--onto` options, and `upstream` and `branch`. More than anything I learned about it by playing with it some.
  - any branch, `git rebase somebranch` means move commits from my current branch which are not on `somebranch` behind `somebranch`
