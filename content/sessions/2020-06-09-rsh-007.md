### Any new tool/concept that you learned in the last week?

- yes: google-benchmark, quite useful for microbenchmarks but their usefulness on the other hand is in question, you can time a snippet of code, it takes care of interferences that you can get by the os eg., <https://github.com/google/benchmark>

```cpp
#include <benchmark/benchmark.h>

static void BM_SomeFunction(benchmark::State& state) {
  // Perform setup here
  for (auto _ : state) {
    // This code gets timed
    SomeFunction();
  }
}
// Register the function as a benchmark
BENCHMARK(BM_SomeFunction);
// Run the benchmark
BENCHMARK_MAIN();

Benchmark                               Time(ns)    CPU(ns) Iterations
----------------------------------------------------------------------
BM_SetInsert/1024/1                        28928      29349      23853  133.097kB/s   33.2742k items/s
BM_SetInsert/1024/8                        32065      32913      21375  949.487kB/s   237.372k items/s
BM_SetInsert/1024/10                       33157      33648      21431  1.13369MB/s   290.225k items/s
```

- I was experimenting with <https://github.com/google/jax> (for automatic differentiation)

- maybe not discovered, but still trying to use gdb for real, it is not too easy to handle


### About the hashbang

- Curiously "/usr/bin/env make -f" works ok on the command line. No quotes.

- there seems to be an answer https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/399690/multiple-arguments-in-shebang
    - `#!/usr/bin/env -S command arg1 arg2 ...`
    - but it says not portable
    - coreutils >= 8.3


### PyPI part

- <https://github.com/bast/pypi-howto>
- <https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/demo-pypi>
- <https://flit.readthedocs.io/>
- <https://python-poetry.org/>


### Packaging

- <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/packaging-software/>
- Is pinning vs not pinning a question of reproducibility vs  replicability?


### Other questions

- Are you planning for a summer break?
  - Great idea. We will and we will be back in August.
