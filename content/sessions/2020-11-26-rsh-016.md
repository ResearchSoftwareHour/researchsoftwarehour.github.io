### Ice-breaker question

What was the most difficult bug you have chased/solved? What was the longest
debugging session/period for you?

- couple of days for one line of code
- couple of hours (around 10h) and learning that it was not straightforward to put simple text into an HDF5 file
- couple of days, most difficult was to find the bug in a part where i was abslutely sure it was right
- couple of days, gave up for a few months (on that new module), solved it in a few hours next time I looked at it. The issue with locating the bug was that debugging/print statements led me to believe that the error was in the wrong part of the code, due to asynchronous execution. In the end, the error was a simple index error.
- over a week. A bug that was very hard to reproduce and trigger. Software had poor test coverage.


### Questions and comments

- Is this related? How to keep an overview about the code that gets more and more complex?
  - definitely related. the more modular and "well structured" code, the easier it may be to locate/corner the bug.

- Python logging module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html

- Git bisect exercise: https://github.com/coderefinery/git-bisect-exercise/


- Error message:

rc = ipp.Client()
rc.ids
executor = rc.become_dask(ncores=4)
executor

- Do you not start at the bottom and read up?
  - this is what I most often do in these cases
    - oops :-) it seems Python and Fortran/C unwind errors in different orders
  - Would say depends a little on the kind of program you are debugging. When using frameworks sometimes the answer is in the middle of the traceback.
  - I usually

* Check changelog as well. Might be that a fix is mentioned.
  - great point!
  - changelogs, issues, pull requests

"Sleep on it" :smile: :+1:
- Ask somebody else to have a look?
  - Also explain it to someone else - See [Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

- Also just trying to explain to the little rubber duck what is happening and what should actually happen.
  - Often I have found the solution by explaining the problem to somebody. So this is real :-)

- The Zen of Python: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/

- TIL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug

The example that we use gdb on (later also Valgrind): https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/demo-debugging :+1:

- fortran example: fortran/bugs/
  - -g -fpe-trap=zero,invalid,overflow,underflow

- Would it be easier to do this in an IDE (?), e.g. like Spyder, where one could see the variable and their values?
  - yes I think so, it's a lot easier to follow the position and see the variables

- Is there a way to print all variables and their values currently in memory? +1
  - yes (I don't remember off-hand how, though)
  - try `help all` in gdb
      - how about in the python (was it pdb?)
          - `import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()`

- I remember in Matlab I could put a command into the code and it would exactly stop there and give me access to the values save in this current moment.
  - yes - a "breakpoint". in python this would be `breakpoint()` after importing `pdb`
  - in visual studio code you can also click next to a line and it sets a breakpoint at that line (never used though, just did it by accident and wondered what was wrong :D)
        - Thank you!
        - See also [debug adapter protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol) and a list of [supported languages](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/implementors/adapters/)

- For Rust developers, I was happy to find out about the macro `dbg!()`

- Have you heard about sourcery?
  - I haven't, please tell us more ...
  - https://sourcery.ai/ ?
    - Yes, I heard about it in a podcast. I thought it checks you code and makes suggestions, maybe another sort of debugging?

- awesome! I missed the variable inpector from Rstudio when starting with python. Now will look into if there is same in VSCode, do you know? -> seems there is under the run debug view (play sign with bug)

- In Matlab the very similar variable inspector could handle the changing variables when one goes into the functions.

- anyone with debugging advice on Haskell? Would like to hear/read any stories.
  - I would also like to know :-)

- https://valgrind.org/

- @bast any chance of showing how to approach a segfault? +2
- even describing what it is. It's still a bit vague to me.
  - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/core-dump-segmentation-fault-c-cpp/
  - Thanks!

- Python takes care of memory leaks?
  - Not really. You can still have them but they have a different form. For instance Python has a Garbage Collector that ensures unused memory is released at specific times when no additional references exist to this memory. You can still have a memory leak if you do something like:

```python
def func(mylist=[]):
    mylist.append("hello")
    print(mylist)

func()
func()
...
```

- any advice on how to detect memory leaks (that are small when testing but may increase later when running with real data) in python?
  - Test the code in loops, repeatedly calling it.
  - Plot your memory usage over time
    - yes, memory profiling. ideally at the end it should be back to zero
        - is there specific tools for memory profiling?

- Any suggestion on detecting memory leaks in CUDA? I know about `cuda-memcheck` (run with `cuda-memcheck [memcheck_options] app_name [app_options]`). Are there other/better alternatives?
    - Looking around, I found [Cudagrind](https://github.com/dpc-grindland/Cudagrind), it hasn't been updated for many years though. Would be nice to see what else can be used.


- Is pair programming sitting down together and work it out together? If yes, it was super fun! A scientist and a software engineer. I guess we learned a lot from each other.
    - Can be but usually refers to "collaborating" in solving problems or implementing solutions (my understanding)
       - My understanding is original, two people and one set of code, one editor.
    - there is also "mob programming": one person types, many others (Twitch :P) are in the same room and navigate, and people give the keyboard to others after some time
      - haha, yes

- RSH live from Nordic RSE: https://nordic-rse.org/events/2020-online-get-together/


Thank you! :) Learned a lot and will start debugging now

Thanks for another great episode of RSHour! :heart: +1 :+1:

Thank you :-)


### Notes we used when planning this session

#### Introduction

- This is a really challenging topic to talk about, since there are
  - So many ways to go wrong
  - So many ways to fix it
  - No one right answer, it's more of an art than a science
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_bugs


#### Types of bugs

- syntax errors
- runtime errors
  - Hard errors that are clearly reported as errors
- results are wrong (like the kelvin example)
- Heisenbug: trying to study the bug changes it, e.g. adding print statements changes timings.  Memory locations change.  etc
  - Compiled with or without optimizations.  Stepped through with debugger to eliminate race conditions.
  - you add a print statement and bug goes away: memory bugs
- schr√∂dinbug: it never worked, but you never noticed it.
- Local (clearly identify to one line) vs systematic (a property of the whole system)


#### Approach to debugging

- Reality not as fancy as you might thing
- Take a break
- Reducing size of the problem
  - Make it run faster, but still produce the bug (smaller input data, less iterations, etc)
  - Removing degrees of freedom: Disable optional features until you get straight to it
  - i thought efficient debugging is like efficient tree-search of possibilities "inside our head": eliminating as big branches as possible as early as possible.
- Finding the point of the problem
  - bisection
    - git bisect: when you have good version control, when was it introduced?
    - Turn off optional features and see if the problem still occurs
    - "Deactivating code"/skipping code to locate memory problems: making the result wrong but making the code not crash
  - git grep
  - it can be useful to make the code produce "not scientifically meaningful" results for the sake of debugging
- Now, you roughly know the point.  What now?
  - Reading error messages
    - How to approach stack traces and finding the problem
    - How to pick the interesting part out of error message: read from both the top and the bottom
    - internet-searching solutions with the right error message
- Turn it into a unit test or example script, that is self-contained
  - Can you make the example portable to someone else to try (git, conda, containers, etc?)
  - This is basically a prerequisite to asking someone for help
- Asking for help
  - When to ask for help (after you have narrowed it down)
  - What to include when asking (not "it doesn't work")
  - what to do if it crashes/fails in somebody else's code (library or package)


#### Preparing code for debugging

- various points from Zen of Python, for example "Errors should never pass silently / unless explicitly silenced", but there is more relevant in it too
- print debugging
- writing good error messages, catching errors the right way
  - don't trap all errors and ignore them
- logging and verbosity
  - shell: set -x
  - -v, -q
  - stdout vs stderr for printing stuff
  - logging module **show example (rkdarst)**
    - Everything defined in levels: debug, info, warning, error, critical
    - https://github.com/NordicHPC/envkernel/blob/master/envkernel.py
- assertions, programming for safety
  - shell script strict modes
    - set -e ; set -u ; set -o pipefail .   often done as set -euo pipefail
- debug compile flags


#### Debuggers and debugging tools

- "debuggers do not remove bugs, they run your code in slow motion"
- **gdb/pdb type interface (AF)**, let it run until error happens
  - demo-debugging/fortran/bugs
  - explicit error to make it start
- print statements
  - Useful as starting point
  - Maybe use logging module instead?
- jupyter: **%%debug (RD)**
- import IPython ; IPython.embed()   or   or from code import interact; interact()
- **Valgrind and memory bugs (Radovan)**
  - C/C++ example with 3 memory bugs (use after free, memory leak, out of bounds access)
- **debugging through IDE**; remote debugging
- **variable inspector (RD)**


#### Bonus if we have time

- git bisect example
