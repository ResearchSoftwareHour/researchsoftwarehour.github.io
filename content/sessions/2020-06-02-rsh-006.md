- What did you work on in the past week?
  - Writing unit tests for (my own) older code.

- Suggestion for next week:
    - byobu, tmux (screen) how to use a shell (connected via ssh) properly
       - followed-up here: https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes/issues/36


### Testing

- testing private methods:
    - depending on the language (Java) you can use introspection to make it non-private
    - in C++ maybe use friend and a second class to make stuff public just for the test
    - in Python, there should not be private methods, simply call the `_foo()`, `__bar()`

- Redirecting `print` output in Python:
```python
import io
import contextlib
my_io_buffer = io.StringIO()
with contextlib.redirect_stdout(my_io_buffer):
    import my_chatty_module # all output is now in the io buffer
    print('abcd') # abcd is now in the io buffer
```
  - [name=Radovan] Nice!
  - pytest has capture output: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/capture.html

- Automated testing
  - Travis validator: https://config.travis-ci.com/explore

- [name=Ashwin] What you describe today is "example-based testing", and also manual "mutation testing".
    - Property testing (for eg. in Python with [`hypothesis`](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
    - todo: let's have a session where we talk about all the different types of tests
      - followed-up here: https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes/issues/37

- who pays for the GitHub Actions CPU power? Is there a limit on seconds per run?
    - GitHub/Microsoft itself. Public repositories free, private have some limits: https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions#usage-limits


### History cleanup

- To rebase / fixup etc. ideally you should work on a local branch, right? i.e. you should not have pushed the commits.
    - Ideally on a local branch but sometimes I do cleanup pushed commits if it is clear to me that nobody depends
      on these commits and clear to everybody that these can change.

- Difference between `git push --force` and `git push --force-with-lease`?
    - Never heard of it before, but this looks promising: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52823692/git-push-force-with-lease-vs-force

- Thank you :-)


### Feedback

- maybe try to mix and make theme based sessions?
- I learned a few useful tricks today, thanks :+1:
- I would also like to see both, "scientific" and "tool" topics! :) Thank you very much! You deserve much more attention/viewers!
