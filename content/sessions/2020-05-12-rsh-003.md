- Specifying dependencies for a project tends to be quite language dependant. There is a strong convention for a requirements.txt in Python for instance. Is there a language independent way to make your dependencies clear and easily usable?
  - Not really. Quite often projects describe their OS/OS library/other library needs in that order.

- Are there specific journals where one can publish science codes/libraries that are applied in scientific projects, together with documentation and a short explanatory paper? Such a 'publication' hardly qualifies for the standard scientific journals, but might still be relevant for publication.
  - These are generally called software metapapers. Some examples:
    - [JOSS](joss.theoj.org/)
    - [JORS](openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/)
    - [SoftwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/softwarex)
  - NeuroImage publishes ["Toolbox and Software"](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/neuroimage/1053-8119/guide-for-authors#txt20105) papers.

- Does meson or scons makes things easier, compared to autotools or a makefile or cmake?
  - Not sure but CMake, autotools, and makefiles clearly dominate research software (as far as I can see)

- Can you FetchContent from Zenodo?
  - it is possible to fetch from a URL/Tarball, I think it should be possible. I will try it out.

- Do you gitignore every dependency under your "external/" subfolder or do you add everything to your repo? (I have found my code in the 'external' subfolder of other repositories)
  - A [solution](http://www.nils-haldenwang.de/frameworks-and-tools/git/how-to-ignore-changes-in-git-submodules) is to set `ignore=dirty` if you use submodules

- [Calendar versioning](https://calver.org/) ? Yes, +1 for calendar versioning.
    - It works for distributions, or websites etc, maybe not for libraries?

- If you're interested on scientific software installation with scientific software build systems, check [spack](https://spack.io/) and [easybuild](https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). -Simo

- On GitHub, if you have lines selected, you can hit "y" to automatically put the permalink with the hash in the URL.
  - awesome!
