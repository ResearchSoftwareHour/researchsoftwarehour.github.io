### Questions

- Thanks for the stream! From what I understood, a virtual environment created
  in conda with all the project dependencies installed in it can be exported
  to a single yml file called environment.yml. I wonder if this file can be
  distributed and anyone who wants to recreate the same virtual environment as
  the original developer, can do so. This will relieve others from having to
  even make use of requirements.txt or install dependencies one by one. But, I
  missed to notice if the size of the file is big and whether this approach of
  distributing your software scales well?
    - Yes, you can share the environment.yml (and in fact, that is one of the main points!  we should have said that)
    - the environment.yml file only has a list of software, not the actual software.  So it is always very tiny, basically one line per package installed.
