# Computers for research 101: The essential course that everyone skipped


## Questions/comments

- Website with a couple of topics planned: https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/

- It is good to count the episodes though maybe you can count seasons i.e. season 2, episode 1 ;)
   - this is then S03E01 :-)
       - wonderful! may many seasons to come!

- converting line endings from Windows to Linux/Unix:
  - dos2unix utility can do that

- htop (a flavor of the "top" command)
- BSD = berkeley systems distrbution, a form of unix

## Our session notes

- We won't talk about theory of computation, hardware, or stuff like that.
- Instead, we talk about the **most common misconceptions** when you start doing more serious work:


### Basics

- Computers are not smart


### Data and files

In many ways, how data works is more important than the computing

- A file is nothing but data - there is nothing special about it
  - file extension is just a hint, nothing more
- Files are not tied to certain programs
  - The more programs that can open a file, the more useful it is
  - Some file formats are designed to be hard to use by other programs - bad for you
  - If a file is simple enough that you can process it yourself
- Users and permissions
  - On your own computer, you may never realize this
  - On a multi-user computer, you need **users** and **permissions**
  - Found with `ls -l`
  - In the background, they even exist on personal computers, phones, etc., but it is designed so that they never get in your way
- Size
  - Obviously, files have a size
  - What's an ideal file size, i.e. when is a file too big to handle and when are (many) small files too many to handle
- Number of files
  - Number of files is rarely a concern on own computers
    - but can be a concern on shared resources which typically impose quota 
  - For serious work, you might end up with lots of files (see: files you can control).  This usually isn't great
- Files on different OSes
  - File systems (NTFS, ext, FAT etc), how about on phones?
  - Line endings (CRLF and LF)
  - [magic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number)
  - [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME)


### Computing

"How computers work" usually focuses on this

- What is a processor
  - Executes instructions
  - We don't compete based on clock speeds anymore
  - Newer ones tend to be more efficient (lower power, more instructions), thus faster
- Parallel: doing multiple things at once
  - Parallel is *tricky*
  - Usually you try to use existing frameworks for certain strategies: mapping, numerical libraries, etc.
  - Just because you have more processors doesn't mean you can use them
- Concurrency vs parallelism
- Real scaling up: distributing strategies
  - multi-threading
  - multi-process
  - MPI
  - Requirements to use a batch system
- Amdahl's law
  - related: as you scale the system/problem, new/unexpected bottlenecks may appear, "O(n2)" 


### Networking

- Schmidt's law: the network becomes the computer
- You need to be able to efficiently work across all computers on a network to take advantage of all tools available
- Server: provides functionality for clients that connect.
  - ???
- Can A connect to B?
- Networked data storage
  - absolutely transformative
  - Makes it easy to transfer files
  - **Mounting** a filesystem makes it available as local files: saves you from even having to transfer files
  - The more places data is available, the more useful it is
  - Common cases: shared home directories.  shared project directories


### Memory?

- swapping
- memory leaks
- what is a memory corruption?
- what is a segfault?
- what is a core dump?
- memory often shows up as bottleneck once we increase system size (example: list comprehension vs generator in Python)


### Operating systems and interfaces

- Windows, Linux, Mac
- These days, the differences between them are decreasing
- Graphical vs command line interface
  - Graphical: easy to get started or do new things, options presented to you
  - Command line: much more powerful, but harder to find things
  - web search + `man` to look up command options


### Using software

Clearly, you need to tell the computer what to do.

- Consumer programs: someone provides it
- Installing things is hard!
  - The fact that people can install software onto own computers has been slowly developed over many years
  - But also means it is tightly controlled: not good for 
- Installing is often possible for everybody
  - EasyBuild/Spack
  - Containers
  - Often different on laptop and cluster 


### Programming

- How to read manuals
- Is the worst kind of error is something that appears to work, but is wrong?  Be safe and "fail fast"
- It is very helpful to know how to make things not horribly inefficient.  It is rarely important to know how to make things as fast as possible.
  - making things more efficient (in time and space) often makes code more complicated (more difficult to understand for others)
- Why is programming so important?
  - You often need to do things which no one else has done
  - You need to do the same thing over and over again
  - Maybe you can get by with less knowledge, but it is much less efficient.
- "Fortran is always fast, Python is always slow"
- "one language is better than another" - on choosing languages
- Can programming be creative?
  - What do you like most about programming? 


### Development environments

- GUI vs console
- ssh
- text editor


### Debugging

- Don't give up as soon as you see an error
- Read carefully from both top and bottom
  - or from bottom to top sometimes 
- Try to identify the key lines and do a web search
  - warnings vs errors 
- If you aren't sure, just try it.  if it breaks, you can try to fix it and then you get more
- Change one thing at a time
- When is a debugger useful?
- Try to halve/reduce the search space
- Go for a walk


### Data management

- when you start doing serious work, don't organize by meeting/assignment: you need something that lasts a long time.


### Security

Information security is a big topic, but is more than you think.

- Confidentiality
  - Prevent access to information
  - What you usually think of for "security"
- Integrity
  - Is the information correct?
  - Example: change hospital records to remove information on allergies to medicines
  - Example: misinformation
- Availability
  - Can you access information when you need it?
  - Example: Lose the laptop that has your thesis on it.
    - is this a good moment to talk about backup? 
  - This is perhaps the most common security problem in research!  We have seen so many times people having horribla

Email
- Phishing: don't believe anything that comes to you, unless you have some particular reason to expect it.  If someone asks you to do something, you can always just not.


### How you learn

How do you learn all of this?

- try it, if you break then fix it and you learned two things
  - most really dangerous things are clear
- trying to solve a real problem instead of a "hello world" example
  - maybe more motivating
  - once you get it to work you solved a real problem and you learned something new 
- Reading documentation
  - tutorials
  - reference
