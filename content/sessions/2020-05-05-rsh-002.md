- Zenodo in google scholar?: https://github.com/openjournals/brief-ideas/issues/132#issuecomment-335700342

- a good topic to discuss at another hour  would be creating a static website with e.g. pelican/hugo and publish on github/gitlab pages
    - rkdarst: nice idea!  The "easy one" is using Jekyll + github pages.  I also tested one using pelican + github actions + github pages.  Which ones are you most interested in?
    - rkdarst: I guess we can start with jekyll+github pages, then do the more davanced one in a later episode.
    - cycomanic: I found hugo and pelican actually nicer to use than jekyll, but any one would be good.
    - rkdarst: This was a test I did, using github actions + sphinx, could be adapted to other things too (very primative): https://github.com/rkdarst/sphinx-actions-test

- Table of contents for Markdown: https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc

- a good link on how to write good commit messages: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

- Maybe show how to alert some specific user to a pull request/issue (from Twitch chat)
    - You can use "@" mentions to have Github/Gitlab notify someone about a conversation, issue, pull request, etc.

- "Some bigger teams have templates for pull requests so that you have to explain what you did, what should be reviewed like Richard just said"

- what are your thoughts on black/yapf talking about autoformat? I have not seen a solution that does not mess up math code
    - If you work on a project that has a long and valuable Git history that hasn't used Black, it can destroy the value of the history (or make it much more difficult to follow)

- #pylint: disable=unused-argument

- autoformat is the prime suspect for pre-commit

- ReproHack: https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/

- How does using a requirements.txt relate to using setuptools and defining dependencies via install_requires in the setup?
  - We got this nice follow-up: https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes/issues/21

- have you guys used poetry? (supposedly the next version of packaging and dependency management) https://python-poetry.org/
  - Radovan: I haven't started using it yet, but have used Pipenv. See also good suggestions in https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes/issues/21

- question: do you document your hints (the textual/visual formatting hints)? to others?
    - http://rkd.zgib.net/wiki/Python/Style
    - listener: great talk about Python formatting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M

- I've set up a Vim keybinding to toggle my linter to care about pep8 formatting or not: https://gist.github.com/wmvanvliet/4aa309c2c3e7228060122e7beda14ece with my own scripts, I don't care about pep8. For public packages, I do.

- why not just install all the main libraries as system libs and then use pip install --user ? Also PYTHONPATH!
    - I think virtualenvironments encourage to code to specific versions much more than general version

- Could you explain in a next session about git hooks?
   - Thanks for the suggestion!

- Could you discuss git bare repos?
  - It is basically everything "below" the `.git/` data you see in a regular repository - no "working directory" checked out files

- Dependencies for C++ would be very interesting.
   - please talk about repositories in C++ or pip for C++ equivalent?
   - using CMake to handle dependencies?
     - Thanks for the suggestion!

- Can you post the link to reprohacks (sp?)
   - https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/

- Git shallow clone could also be interesting to discuss
    - you can specify depth as well
    - Thanks for the suggestion!
