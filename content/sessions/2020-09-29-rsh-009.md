### Icebreaker

How do you backup your work and your ideas?

- google drive :) (google docs). I can write things down from anywhere
- google keep, gist, hackmd
- notes on paper, notes in [Joplin app](https://joplinapp.org), mails to myself (mostly for stuff I find on Twitter), open issues in GitHub repos
- markdown, LaTeX, and org-mode in a Git repo stored in Dropbox
- Everything I do is in Github as soon at it is more than just an idea. I wish the professor of our group had a common Github for our group (like many top groups), for his own sake, too (the lottery problem you mentioned)


### Questions and answers

* octobox.io is amazing for keeping track of issues across GitHub repos
  - thanks!!!

- How do you keep the overview? Example: I have a .py module with a class and lot of subfunction and invisible functions with underscore. Is there a way how to keep track of it? To have an overview, what functions exist?
    - How could I organise the functions inside a module?
    - One option is to generate API reference using Sphinx which will list all functions.
    - Also if it becomes a bit hard to navigate, it can help to split the module into smaller modules.

- cryptpad.fr -> kanban board

- has anyone used github projects 
  - we use it but it's a bit behind: https://github.com/orgs/coderefinery/projects

- Can you talk about continuous integration (in general)?
  - great suggestion, we should do a session on this in case we run out of time today
  - oh yeah, I would to see a session on that (Travis vs GitHub Actions vs Circle CI vs Drone, etc.)
  - We've had some previous episodes that mentioned github actions.  We'd like to do more again.

- Q: What is a kanban board, please?
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board

- I think not all files can be kept track with git? Am I wrong? What would happen with .docx  files?
  - Formats with flat text files (tex, md, rst) indeed work better with Git

- Nice Rust reimplementations of classic command line tools:
  - exa, ripgrep, fd, bat
  - What are the original ones implemented in? Perl?
    - I think mostly in C

- What are the differences between bash and zsh? What are some useful `alias`es or other shell configurations to have?
  - I liked that in zsh I could more easily mass-rename files. Also good for "remove all except one file".
