### Outline

#### intro to RSH

- Who are we?
- What is RSH
- Who are we for? And who is this for?
- About our 2021 program: https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/

#### Intro to today

- What we are doing today
- Who do we imagine you to be? (what does each person get?)
  - You may be a new or experienced researcher, working on things.
  - You may have been directed here to get an overview of what you can improve.
    You may be working with someone who will guide you through this
  - You may be a supervisor, who needs to ensure your students do good work


#### [The Zen of Scientific computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/zen-of-scicomp/)

- For each topic:
  - Introduce it
  - Give an example of it going wrong
  - Give an example of it going right
  - Discussion
  - Where do we recommend someone go next?


#### Future

- About rest of RSH
- What's your future?

### Questions/comments

Hey, yes it is good with all three of you :-)

- Oh yes! I guess my coding style is far from industry standard XD and
  difficult to understand for anyone including me in the future ....
   - haha. welcome!

- Nice paper: "Good enough practices in scientific computing" https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510

- do your arguments change if it is a one-time-code which is never published but you only describe its functionality in the paper? (including sanity tests using theoretical arguments) and which cannot be refactored in a general tool? And it is only used by one person?
  - hmmm.... great question! I think I would call this research/test code (now
    that I understood the definition better)
  - a one-time-code? I have never seen a code you use only once.
  - this is the general theme of our research: you have a specialized problem
    where you program a tailored tool for. But it is not really adapting to
    more than this single scenario, even increasing parameters implies a
    combinatorial explosion

- When does research code become production code and how?
  - as soon as it starts being used for research/publication? (unsure)
  - "Experiment(al) code"?

- Also reminded me of https://xkcd.com/2347/

- Any "Big data effort"... run once, almost impossible to run again
  - is it because of the data part? or the workflow part? or the compute resources needed?
  - a bit of everything I'd say. Often things change halfway. The cost of
    recomputing is proportionally larger. Debugging is equally harder. A
    reproducibility challenge.

- Single person project - "collaborating with your past self"
  - oh yes that's a great description
  
- Version control: add new level, web service for just yourself

- Packaged and published
  - which is many layers. But it helps to use standard solutions for this instead of inventing a new one.

- Where do you place tools like mypy? static code evaluators?
  - automated testing and also modular/reusable code development
