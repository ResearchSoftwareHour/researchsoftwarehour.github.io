### Icebreaker

Where are you watching from and how is the weather at your place?

- Tromso, 5 C, heavy rain since days
- Helsinki, 15-20C, cloudy but not much rain (feels like +1)
- Metro between Kamppi and Rautatieasema, dark outside
- Stockholm, 13.3C, dark but dry


### First time with command line

- Commodore 64 :D (yes I am that old) +1
- ZX spectrum
- FreeBSD vtty

### Questions

- bash: "for" unfortunately does not end with "rof"
  - good point :-)
  - haha, great!

- I am not familiar with this expression. It get's parsed? What does it mean, please?
  - Intuitively: "parsed" as in "read and understood" by the script
    
- Have a look at [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire#basic-usage) which is like click, but less boilerplate (but maybe not so powerful as click) +1
    - Fairly used, but not as  popular as click.
- +1 for reading from file (especially a struct like written in json)

- What are the underscores for, please?
  - with `-I _` I instructed xargs to replace underscores by the files it got from `find`, this was my choice, I could have done `-I x` instead and then it would replace "x"

- Python:
```py
from multiprocessing import Pool
from pathlib import Path

def task(filename):
    # computationally intensive task
    # or even shell process using os.system(..) or subprocess.run(..)
    print(filename)


with Pool() as pool:
    files = Path.cwd().glob("*.jpg")
    pool.map(task, files)
```
