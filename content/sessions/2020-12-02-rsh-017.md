### Warm-up question: what do you like in a programming language?

- tooling, documentation, community +1
- available packages/libraries
- clarity of code written in it


### Material used during the stream

- https://github.com/dev-cafe/rust-demo
- https://github.com/annefou/rust-examples


### Rough outline

- About RSH
- Why Rust
- History of Rust
- Memory model
- Examples
- Running Rust on Binder
- Interfacing with other languages


### Questions/comments/resources

History:

Tools written in Rust:
- `exa`, `ripgrep`, `bat`, and `fd` written in Rust (you really want these tools!).
- Great overview of tools written in Rust: https://www.wezm.net/v2/posts/2020/100-rust-binaries/

Questions:
- How good is the multi-dimensional array and plotting functionality in Rust?
  (numpy, matplotlib equivalents)
  - there are plotting libraries but what I have done until now is to plot in
	Python/R and let Rust to compute the csv data :-) not because Rust was bad
	at it but because I knew the Python/R better.

- Can you comment on where Rust stands right now with respect to the packages
  available that offer functionalities for scientific computing ?, for example,
  numpy, scipy equivalents, packages for machine learning, etc. Do you think it
  is sufficient for general scientific computing with what it provides out of
  the box? Assuming that it is a relatively new language, the packages/library
  will certainly grow over time but would like to know what is the current
  scenario.
  - this is not really answering the question but I find the library ecosystem
	surprisingly rich. Still it's not yet on par with numpy and others but then
	a nice combination can be Python on top, orchestrating the input and output
	and libraries and Rust underneath for the "heavy lifting".
  - Thanks, that gives an insight, especially since Rust is primarily a systems
	language as I understand as of now. So, I can imagine that one would most
	often not need all the packages/libraries which can instead come from
	python as you mentioned, and Rust can make the whole application execute
	fast and offer a programming environment that is memory safe.
