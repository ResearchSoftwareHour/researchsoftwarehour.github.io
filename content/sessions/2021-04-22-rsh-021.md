## Open Broadcaster Software

- https://obsproject.com/
- https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/obs/


## Topics

- What is streaming?
- What is OBS?
    - [Open Broadcast Software](https://obsproject.com/)

- Benefits over Zoom:
    - Can be used in tandem with Twitch to broadcast without needing a Zoom broadcast lisence or risking Zoom-bombing

- OBS user interface
    - Scenes
        - to set and configure various `source` settings
        - possible to have media files and scenes within scenes
        - can be shared by exporting/importing
    - Audio mixer:
        - track feature: maybe useful to keep only speaker audio
    - Settings:
        - Defaults are generally good
        - General (mainly related to UI)
        - Audio (various devices)
        - Video (resolution and so on)
        - Output
    - Virtual Camera:
        - Fancy effects, some people use it for teaching

- Basic arrangement of scenes and stuff
- practical notes


## Questions:
- Can we discuss file formats and containers for saving audio/video files in general, and in OBS context in particular.
  - outputs into standard container formats
  - originally used mp4 but complicated file recovery if computer crashes
  - these days using mov format (but same problem as above)
  - mkv: unsure whether it can make trouble with YouTube upload
  - important to note: container formats and encoding formats can be handled separately
  - Rate control:
      - for streaming - constant bit rate is recommended (to be confirmed)
      - CRF - constant rate factor - a variable bitrate that is adjusted to make sure that quality is constant, good for recording (think filesize)
  - recommendations: https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/obs/#basic-configuration

 On twitch - couldn't hear Radovan, also audio is now having a white noise (after attaching the midi controller)
  - thanks for the note and sorry for the troubles

- You probably saw it already: it is possible to control scenes and such without an external midi-controller, in the settings via key-bindings.
