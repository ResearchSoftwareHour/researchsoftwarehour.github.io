# CodeRefinery workshop questions revisited

Questions taken from https://coderefinery.github.io/2021-05-10-workshop/questions/


- The biggest challenge is on-boarding new collaborators with no prior version control experience.:+1:
  - answered, first question

- How do you reject changes? I have received a pull request that I don't want to merge. I have reviewed and asked for changes. What happens now? What if I wanted to just "reject" the request?
  - answered at 10:40

- AFAIK git only works with plaintext source files. Is it possible to use with word files somehow? :+1::+1:
   - answered at 15:30

- Since I am beginner I have issues with merge and rebase. I would like to know which is better in what circumstances. :+1: :+1:
   - answered at 21:30

- Do you always work from terminal? are git GUIs really that useless?:+1:
  - answered at 26:00

- What if our code get used, but doesn't get cited? :+1:
  - answered at 29:05

- What is the main purpose of a DOI link? Why not simply cite the link address of the Github repository? :+1:
  - Answered as part of the above

- How do we test functions whose output is unknown to us? I.e. we know what they are supposed to do but don't know whether the result is correct or not :+1:
  - answered at 34:00

- Some people like to collect functions in a script at the beginning/in the end of a script, others split them into several files that are then called from a master script (commonly done e.g. in R projects). What do you recommend? Should functions in external files come with a test? :+1:
  - answered at 40:05

- Where/how to store data used in notebooks? :+1: 
  - answered at 43:15

- why a workflow and not a simple script? :+1:
  - answered at around 48:15

- could you explain the "detached HEAD" thing? :+1:
  - answered at 54:30

- Is there best practice for testing out whether changes on multiple branches actually "work" together? :+1:
  - answered 57:10


## Please vote on questions below by adding :+1:

- Can I use other text editors than nano?

- I am having trouble understanding the difference between the use of reset and checkout commands.
  - Is the diagram in the staging area episode correct? (https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/04-staging-area/#staging-area-commands)

- What are the main differences between Github and Gitlab ? what are the advantages / drawbacks of each?


- Have been using Git repositories & zenodo for documenting reseach code for publications, and done some collaborative work on Git (2-3 collaborators), but very little with "proper" branching,merging etc. Would like to have a more structured approach and make this a more established practice in the group (sharing repos, collaborative remote work, code review, and then archiving the repo for publication)

- I have a question regarding importing history. When is this useful and which actions allow to do that and which do not? (forking, cloning, creating from template, etc.)

- How to make randomness reproducible?

- How to version data is a frequent question I am asked. How should we store, archive or manage large data sets in a way that is compatible with reproducibility goals?

- any advantages to using conda over pip or vice-versa?

- What is derivative work and what is not? 

- Not sure I understand the usefulness or expected use of a Binder. You pack all the dependencies and the projet code in one place and share with others. But can the others then run this on their local drive (like cloning a repo) and having all the materials, or is this just a sort of "online simulator" of your environment? In which situations is it then useful to create a Binder?

- Comments on numerical precision, 0.2+0.3 != 0.5

- Would you prefer your code to be 2x slower if it was easier to read it?

- How do we go about modular code development if we are starting somewhere fresh, but there exists some previous code version which serves as a base (and this is not modular)?

- What does “modular code development” mean for you?

- Are there any recommendations/tips to test for modularity?

- Can I share a notebook I created using CR conda env with someone who do not have it ?
