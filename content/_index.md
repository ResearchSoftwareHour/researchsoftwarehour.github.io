**Research Software Hour** is an online stream/show about scientific computing and
research software.  It is designed to provide the skills typically picked up
via informal networks: each ~2 weeks, we do some combination of exploring new
tools, analyzing and improving someone's research code, and discussion.

Watchers can take part and contribute code to us which we analyze and discuss
on stream.

In Autumn 2021, we stream **Wednesdays at 14:00
Central European time / 15:00 East Europe time**. [Convert 14:00 to your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Stockholm/2021-09-08/14:00/w/Research%20Software%20Hour#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXRjaC50di9SU0hvdXIifQ==)

* How to use SSH and GPG keys (we all need them sooner or later, it is "never" taught, and documentation is often not adapted to non-experts)
* Licensing and sharing: what do you need to know in practice (e.g. How to agree on code and licensing)
* Shell: advanced tricks we use
* Testing
* Publishing and releasing software.  Making your code ready for
  publication in [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/)
