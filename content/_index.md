**Research Software Hour** is an online stream/show about scientific computing and
research software.  It is designed to provide the skills typically picked up
via informal networks: every few weeks, we do some combination of exploring new
tools, analyzing and improving someone's research code, and
discussion.  Think of it as the "fireside chat" of scientific computing.

Watchers can take part by suggesting ideas, contribute code or
problems to discuss on stream, or even joining to directly be a part
of the show.

We hope to resume in Spring 2022.
<!--In Autumn 2021, we stream **Wednesdays at 14:00
Central European time / 15:00 East Europe time**. [Convert 14:00 to your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Stockholm/2021-09-08/14:00/w/Research%20Software%20Hour#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXRjaC50di9SU0hvdXIifQ==)-->

## Upcoming shows

* Working with SSH
* Lessons from starting a RSE group at a university
* How to organize software/data in a new research group
* How to manage code on a research-group level (for group leaders, how to prevent everyone from doing their own things)
* How to use SSH and GPG keys (we all need them sooner or later, it is "never" taught, and documentation is often not adapted to non-experts)
* Licensing and sharing: what do you need to know in practice (e.g. How to agree on code and licensing)
* Shell: advanced tricks we use
* Testing
* Publishing and releasing software.  Making your code ready for
  publication in [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/)
* Renv / Julia environment reproducibity
* Our favourite R libraries
* Desktop to cluster
* Cluster: working efficiently
* Strategies to parallelize a code
* Writing parallel code
* Finding and solving memory bottlenecks, especially in Python
* How to run a Python web service or in other words: what to do when you need more than a static website?
