**Research Software Hour** is an online stream/show about scientific computing and
research software.  It is designed to provide the skills typically picked up
via informal networks: each week, we do some combination of exploring new
tools, analyzing and improving someone's research code, and discussion.

Watchers can take part and contribute code to us which we analyze and discuss
on stream.

Since April 2021, we stream whenever we have an interesting topic.

## Upcoming shows

Thursday, 22 April at 15:00 CEST, we will have a demo on OBS (Open
Broadcaster Software) for teaching purposes.  This is more like an
internal demo that is open to all, than a purpose-built show.


## Other future topics

* How to manage code on a research-group level (for group leaders, how to prevent everyone from doing their own things)
* How to use SSH and GPG keys (we all need them sooner or later, it is "never" taught, and documentation is often not adapted to non-experts)
* Licensing and sharing: what do you need to know in practice (e.g. How to agree on code and licensing)
* Shell: advanced tricks we use
* Testing
* Publishing and releasing software.  Making your code ready for
  publication in [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/)
* Renv / Julia environment reproducibity
* Our favourite R libraries
* Desktop to cluster
* Cluster: working efficiently
* Strategies to parallelize a code
* Writing parallel code
* Finding and solving memory bottlenecks, especially in Python
* How to run a Python web service or in other words: what to do when you need more than a static website?
* Containers
