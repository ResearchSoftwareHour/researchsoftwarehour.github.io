# How to watch

There are several ways to reach us:

- The **[Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/rshour)**
  * You can use the Twitch chat to interact with us, but we prefer the
    HackMD pad (because we won't miss stuff, can thread discussions,
    and share it afterwards).
- Right now, we broadcast whenever we have a topic.  Follow one of our
  Twitter accounts (see below) for announcements.
- <strike>We broadcast <s>Tuesdays</s> **Thursdays** at 20:30 Oslo time / 21:30 Helsinki time.
  [Convert to your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Helsinki/2020-05-05/21:30/w/Research%20Software%20Hour#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3R3aXRjaC50di9SU0hvdXIifQ==).
  Or on Linux, run:
  ```
  $ date --date='TZ="Europe/Helsinki" 21:30 next Thu'
  ```
  </strike>
- A [**HackMD pad**](https://hackmd.io/@researchsoftwarehour/questions), which we use to share code, links, etc.
  - Always write at the very bottom of the hackpad, unless you are
    replying to someone.
  - You may also write questions at the end of the hackpad.
  - Answer other people in the hackpad.
- Give us **suggestions as issues** in
  [the rsh-notes repository](https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes/issues).
  We would especially like contributed research code (open
  licenseable), which we can analyze on-stream and give (constructive)
  suggestions for improving reproducibility.
- Updates/news on **Twitter** [@\_\_radovan](https://twitter.com/__radovan) or
  [@SciCompAalto](https://twitter.com/SciCompAalto).
- [Video archive](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJAB6blBBa0O2BEYadVZV3JYf)
